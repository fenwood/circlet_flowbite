                    We have been serving barbeque fare at events for over 10 years at local events and festivals in the Belleville, ON area. We are a small, family operated food services business and our philosophy has always been great food at a fair price. 
                </p>
                <p>We're obsessed with delivering that down-home, smoked goodness that makes every gathering unforgettable. Our low-and-slow method means juicy, fall-off-the-bone brisket, tender pulled pork, and ribs that'll have your guests licking their fingers.</p>

                    Our all-beef hot dogs are like a summer day wrapped in a bun. Topped with zesty relish, tangy mustard, and a sprinkle of nostalgia, theyâ€™re the ultimate crowd-pleaser. We source all our meats from local butchers and only use the best quality hot dogs. We also offer Polish, German and Italian sasuages.
